# Error Handling & Resilience Checker

## READ-ONLY CONSTRAINT

**This sub-skill is strictly read-only. Never modify, write, edit, or delete any file in the user's codebase. Report findings only.**

---

## Domain Scope

This sub-skill detects error handling and resilience issues across these categories:

1. **Swallowed Exceptions** — Empty catch blocks, catch-and-log-only without rethrow/handle
2. **Missing Error Handling** — External API calls without try/catch, unhandled promise rejections
3. **Error Information** — Generic error messages, leaking internals, missing structured responses
4. **Retry & Circuit Breaker** — No timeout on external calls, no retry for transient failures
5. **Validation** — Missing input validation, implicit null assumptions, type coercion bugs
6. **Transaction Safety** — Multi-step DB operations without transactions, missing rollback
7. **Logging** — No logging on critical paths, missing correlation IDs

---

## What It Does NOT Flag

- **Sensitive data in logs** — covered by `codeprobe-security` (`SEC` prefix). This sub-skill flags *missing* logging and *structural* issues like no correlation IDs, not data leakage.
- **Test files** — test exception handling follows different patterns and is expected to be simpler.
- **Framework-generated exception handlers** (e.g., Laravel's `Handler.php`, Next.js error boundaries that are intentionally minimal) — these are scaffolded defaults, not developer oversights.
- **CLI scripts with intentionally simple error handling** (print + exit) — command-line tools often use a valid pattern of printing an error and exiting with a non-zero code.
- **Catch blocks that deliberately swallow specific known-harmless exceptions** with a comment explaining why — if the developer documented the rationale, respect the decision.

## Detection Instructions

### Swallowed Exceptions

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ERR` | Empty catch blocks | Search for `catch` blocks with empty body, only `pass`, only `// ignored`, or only a comment. In JS/TS: `catch (e) {}`. In PHP: `catch (\Exception $e) {}`. In Python: `except: pass` or `except Exception: pass`. | Major |
| `ERR` | Catch-log-only without handling | Find catch blocks that only contain a log/print statement but don't rethrow, return an error, or take any recovery action. The exception is swallowed after logging. | Minor |
| `ERR` | Overly broad exception catching | `catch (\Exception $e)`, `catch (Exception e)`, bare `except:` in Python, `catch (e)` catching all errors. Flag when a more specific exception type should be caught. | Major |

### Missing Error Handling

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ERR` | External API calls without try/catch | Search for HTTP client calls (Guzzle, axios, fetch, requests, HttpClient), payment SDK calls (Stripe, PayPal), AWS SDK calls, and other external service integrations. Flag when these calls are NOT wrapped in try/catch or .catch(). | Major |
| `ERR` | Unhandled promise rejections | Search for async functions or promise chains without `.catch()` or surrounding try/catch. Look for floating promises (async call without await). In Node.js, check for missing `unhandledRejection` handler. | Major |
| `ERR` | File I/O without error handling | `file_get_contents`, `fopen`, `fs.readFile`, `open()` (Python) without try/catch for IOError/FileNotFoundError. | Minor |

### Error Information

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ERR` | Generic error messages | API responses returning only "Something went wrong", "Internal server error", or similar without error codes or actionable detail for the client. | Minor |
| `ERR` | Leaking internal errors to API consumers | Exception messages, stack traces, SQL errors, or file paths exposed in API JSON/HTML responses. Check error handling middleware configuration. | Major |
| `ERR` | Missing structured error responses | API endpoints returning errors without consistent structure (no error code field, no message field, inconsistent formats across endpoints). | Minor |

### Retry & Circuit Breaker

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ERR` | External service calls without timeout | HTTP client calls without timeout configuration. Guzzle without `timeout` option, axios without `timeout`, requests without `timeout` param, fetch without AbortController. | Major |
| `ERR` | No retry for transient failures | External API calls that could fail transiently (HTTP 429, 503, network errors) with no retry mechanism. | Minor |
| `ERR` | No circuit breaker for cascading failures | Service-to-service calls in microservice architectures with no circuit breaker or fallback pattern. | Suggestion |

### Validation

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ERR` | Missing input validation before processing | Functions that accept external input (request params, file contents, API payloads) and use them directly without validation. | Major |
| `ERR` | Implicit null assumptions | Accessing properties or calling methods on values that could be null/undefined without null checks. Chaining `.` access on possibly-null return values. | Minor |
| `ERR` | Type coercion bugs | PHP `==` instead of `===` for security-sensitive comparisons. JS `==` instead of `===`. Implicit type conversions that could produce unexpected results. | Minor |

### Transaction Safety

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ERR` | Multi-step DB ops without transactions | Multiple `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` queries in sequence (same method) without `DB::transaction()`, `atomic()`, `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, or equivalent. If any step fails, data is left in an inconsistent state. | Critical |
| `ERR` | Transaction without proper rollback | Transaction blocks that catch exceptions but don't rollback, or that have code after the transaction that assumes success without checking. | Major |

### Logging

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ERR` | No logging on critical failure paths | Catch blocks in critical business logic (payment, auth, order processing) that don't include any logging. Failures happen silently. | Major |
| `ERR` | Missing correlation/request IDs | Log statements in request-handling code without correlation ID, request ID, or trace ID. Makes debugging distributed issues impossible. | Minor |

## Reference Loading

If the project uses a specific framework or language, load the relevant reference file from `../codeprobe/references/{file}.md` using Read. Available references include:

- `php-laravel.md` for PHP/Laravel projects (DB::transaction, queue retry patterns)
- `javascript-typescript.md` for JS/TS projects (async/await error handling, Promise patterns)
- `python.md` for Python projects (Django/FastAPI exception handlers, context managers)

If the reference file is unavailable, continue the analysis without it.

---

## Output Contract

Every finding MUST include ALL of the following fields:

```json
{
  "id": "ERR-{NNN}",
  "severity": "critical|major|minor|suggestion",
  "location": { "file": "path/to/file.ext", "lines": "45-120" },
  "problem": "One sentence describing what's wrong",
  "evidence": "Concrete proof from the code — quote specific patterns, counts, names",
  "suggestion": "Human-readable recommendation",
  "fix_prompt": "Copy-pasteable prompt for Claude Code to apply the fix. Must reference specific file names, line ranges, method names, and the exact change to make.",
  "refactored_sketch": "// optional: minimal code showing the fix direction"
}
```

### ID Prefix

All findings use the `ERR-` prefix, numbered sequentially: `ERR-001`, `ERR-002`, `ERR-003`, etc.

### Rendered Finding Format

```
### {ID} | {Severity} | `{file}:{lines}`

**Problem:** {problem description}

**Evidence:**
> {quoted code patterns, specific variable names, line references, data flow description}

**Suggestion:** {what to do to fix it}

**Fix prompt:**
> {copy-pasteable prompt for Claude Code}

**Refactored sketch:** (optional)
```

### Fix Prompt Examples

- "Wrap the Stripe API call in `PaymentService@charge` (line 55) in a try/catch for `\Stripe\Exception\ApiErrorException`. Log the error with context (`$orderId`, `$amount`) and throw a domain-specific `PaymentFailedException` with a user-friendly message."
- "Add `DB::transaction()` around the order creation flow in `OrderService@create` (lines 40-65) which currently creates an Order, OrderItems, and Payment record in three separate queries. If any step fails, all should roll back."
- "Replace the empty catch block at `app/Services/NotificationService.php:88` with proper error handling: log the exception with notification context, then decide whether to rethrow (critical notification) or swallow with a metric (non-critical)."
- "Add timeout and retry configuration to the HTTP client call at `ExternalApiClient.php:30`. Use `->timeout(10)->retry(3, 100)` for the Guzzle request to handle transient network failures."

## Execution Modes

This sub-skill supports three modes, set by the orchestrator:

### `full` Mode
Analyze the target path thoroughly. Scan every source file for all error handling categories. Produce detailed findings for every detected issue with all required fields (id, severity, location, problem, evidence, suggestion, fix_prompt). Include refactored_sketch for critical findings. Trace exception flow and identify silent failure paths where possible.

### `scan` Mode
Quick count of issues by severity. Identify the worst offenders (files with the most error handling problems). Skip the `evidence` and `fix_prompt` fields. Return:
- Count of issues per category (Swallowed Exceptions, Missing Error Handling, Error Information, Retry & Circuit Breaker, Validation, Transaction Safety, Logging)
- Count by severity (critical, major, minor, suggestion)
- Top 3 most problematic files with brief descriptions

### `score-only` Mode
Count issues by severity per category. Return only the summary counts — no individual findings, no evidence, no fix prompts. Output the summary object only.

---

## Summary Output

At the end of every execution (regardless of mode), provide a summary:

```json
{
  "skill": "codeprobe-error-handling",
  "summary": { "critical": 0, "major": 0, "minor": 0, "suggestion": 0 }
}
```

Replace the zeros with actual counts from the analysis.
