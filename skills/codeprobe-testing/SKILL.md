# Test Quality & Coverage Auditor

## READ-ONLY CONSTRAINT

**This sub-skill is strictly read-only. Never modify, write, edit, or delete any file in the user's codebase. Report findings only.**

---

## Domain Scope

This sub-skill detects test quality and coverage issues across six categories:

1. **Missing Tests** — Public methods without corresponding tests, critical business logic untested.
2. **Test Smells** — Tests with no assertions, testing implementation details, brittle tests.
3. **Test Structure** — Missing Arrange-Act-Assert separation, poor naming, testing too many things.
4. **Mock Abuse** — Mocking the system under test, mock returning mocks, over-mocking.
5. **Coverage Gaps** — No tests for error paths, authorization logic, edge cases.
6. **Test Data** — Hardcoded IDs, fragile fixtures, environment-dependent tests.

---

## What It Does NOT Flag

- **Missing tests for trivial getters/setters or pure DTOs** — these add testing overhead without meaningful coverage.
- **Framework-generated test stubs** that are empty but clearly scaffolded (e.g., Laravel's `ExampleTest.php`, Create React App's `App.test.js`) — these are starting points, not abandoned tests.
- **Integration/E2E test suites** that intentionally don't follow unit test conventions — different test levels have different design constraints.
- **Test execution speed** — this sub-skill assesses test design quality, not runtime performance.
- **Tests in `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, or other dependency directories.**

## Detection Instructions

### Missing Tests

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| `TEST` | Public methods with no corresponding test | Scan source directories for public class methods. For each, check if a corresponding test file/method exists. Use test file naming conventions: `test_`, `_test.`, `.test.`, `Test[A-Z]`, `spec_`, `_spec.`, `.spec.` (matching `file_stats.py` patterns). | Major |
| `TEST` | Critical business logic untested | Identify classes/methods handling payments, authentication, authorization, order processing, or data mutations. Check whether these have dedicated test coverage. | Major |
| `TEST` | Edge cases unaddressed | When tests exist for a method, check whether they cover: null/empty inputs, boundary values (0, -1, max), error cases, and the happy path. Flag methods with only happy-path tests. | Minor |

### Test Smells

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| `TEST` | Tests with no assertions | Search test methods for assertion calls (`assert`, `expect`, `should`, `verify`). Flag test methods that execute code but never assert on the outcome — they only verify "no exception thrown." | Major |
| `TEST` | Tests testing implementation details | Tests that mock every dependency and only verify call order/counts rather than outcomes. Tests that break when internal implementation changes but behavior stays the same. Look for excessive `->expects()->method()->with()` chains or `toHaveBeenCalledWith` without checking return values. | Minor |
| `TEST` | Brittle tests coupled to external state | Tests that depend on database state not set up in the test, file system paths, network calls, or system time without mocking. Look for raw SQL in tests, `file_exists()` checks, HTTP calls without mocking. | Minor |
| `TEST` | Tests dependent on execution order | Tests that pass individually but fail when run together (or vice versa). Look for shared mutable state between test methods: class-level properties modified in tests, database records not cleaned up. | Major |

### Test Structure

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| `TEST` | Missing Arrange-Act-Assert separation | Test methods where setup, execution, and assertion are interleaved rather than clearly separated. Multiple act+assert cycles in one test. | Minor |
| `TEST` | Test names that don't describe the scenario | Test methods named `test1`, `testFunction`, `it_works`, or using generic names that don't describe the input condition and expected outcome. Good: `test_empty_cart_returns_zero_total`. Bad: `testCalculate`. | Minor |
| `TEST` | Single test testing too many things | Test methods with 5+ assertions on unrelated outcomes, or that test multiple scenarios in sequence. Should be split into focused tests. | Minor |

### Mock Abuse

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| `TEST` | Mocking the system under test | Test creates a mock/partial mock of the class being tested. The test is testing the mock, not the actual code. Look for `$this->createPartialMock(ClassName::class)` or `jest.spyOn(sut, 'method')` where sut is the class being tested. | Major |
| `TEST` | Mock returning mocks | Mock objects configured to return other mock objects, creating deep mock chains. `$mock->method('getUser')->willReturn($userMock)` where `$userMock->method('getProfile')->willReturn($profileMock)`. | Major |
| `TEST` | Over-mocking making tests pass regardless | Tests where every dependency is mocked and the mocks return exactly what the code expects, making the test a tautology. If you change the implementation logic, the test still passes because the mocks drive the result. | Minor |

### Coverage Gaps

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| `TEST` | No tests for error/exception paths | Methods with try/catch blocks or error handling where tests only cover the success path. No test triggers the catch/error branch. | Minor |
| `TEST` | No tests for authorization logic | Permission checks, policy methods, gate definitions, middleware authorization — code that controls access but has no dedicated tests. | Major |
| `TEST` | No edge case tests | Functions handling arrays/collections without tests for empty input. Numeric functions without tests for zero, negative, or boundary values. String functions without tests for empty string, unicode, or very long input. | Minor |

### Test Data

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| `TEST` | Hardcoded IDs that may collide | Tests using hardcoded numeric IDs (`$userId = 42`, `id: 1`) instead of factory-generated values. These collide in parallel test runs or with seeded data. | Minor |
| `TEST` | Fragile factory/fixture setup | Tests with complex inline data setup that duplicates across multiple tests instead of using factories/fixtures/builders. | Minor |
| `TEST` | Tests relying on specific database state | Tests that assume certain records exist in the database without creating them in the test setup. Depends on seeders or previous test execution. | Minor |

## Reference Loading

If the project uses a specific framework or language, load the relevant reference file from `../codeprobe/references/{file}.md` using Read. Available references include:

- `php-laravel.md` for PHPUnit/Pest testing patterns
- `javascript-typescript.md` for Jest/Vitest testing patterns
- `python.md` for pytest/unittest patterns

If the reference file is unavailable, continue the analysis without it.

---

## Output Contract

Every finding MUST include ALL of the following fields:

```json
{
  "id": "TEST-{NNN}",
  "severity": "critical|major|minor|suggestion",
  "location": { "file": "path/to/file.ext", "lines": "45-120" },
  "problem": "One sentence describing what's wrong",
  "evidence": "Concrete proof from the code — quote specific patterns, counts, names",
  "suggestion": "Human-readable recommendation",
  "fix_prompt": "Copy-pasteable prompt for Claude Code to apply the fix. Must reference specific file names, line ranges, method names, and the exact change to make.",
  "refactored_sketch": "// optional: minimal code showing the fix direction"
}
```

### ID Prefix

- `TEST-` — All test quality and coverage findings

Number findings sequentially: `TEST-001`, `TEST-002`, `TEST-003`, etc.

### Rendered Finding Format

```
### {ID} | {Severity} | `{file}:{lines}`

**Problem:** {problem description}

**Evidence:**
> {quoted code patterns, method names, counts, specific line references}

**Suggestion:** {what to do to fix it}

**Fix prompt:**
> {copy-pasteable prompt for Claude Code}

**Refactored sketch:** (optional)
```

### Fix Prompt Examples

- "Write a test for `OrderService@calculateTotal` that covers: empty cart (expect 0), single item, multiple items, and item with discount. Use `OrderFactory` for test data. Place in `tests/Unit/Services/OrderServiceTest.php`."
- "The test `test_user_can_login` at `tests/Feature/AuthTest.php:25` has no assertions — it only calls the login endpoint. Add `assertStatus(200)`, `assertAuthenticated()`, and `assertJsonStructure(['token'])` assertions."
- "In `tests/Unit/PaymentServiceTest.php:40`, the mock chain is mocking too deeply. Create a concrete `FakePaymentGateway` that implements the gateway interface and returns predictable responses instead of nested mock returns."
- "Replace the hardcoded user ID `42` in `tests/Feature/OrderTest.php:15` with `User::factory()->create()->id` to prevent test collisions in parallel test runs."

## Execution Modes

This sub-skill supports three modes, set by the orchestrator:

### `full` Mode
Analyze the target path thoroughly. Produce detailed findings for every detected violation with all required fields (id, severity, location, problem, evidence, suggestion, fix_prompt). Include refactored_sketch for major and critical findings where it adds clarity.

### `scan` Mode
Quick count of violations by severity. Identify the worst offenders (files/classes with the most violations). Skip the `evidence` and `fix_prompt` fields. Return:
- Count of violations per category (Missing Tests, Test Smells, Test Structure, Mock Abuse, Coverage Gaps, Test Data)
- Count by severity (critical, major, minor, suggestion)
- Top 3 worst-offending files with brief descriptions

### `score-only` Mode
Count violations by severity per category. Return only the summary counts — no individual findings, no evidence, no fix prompts. Output the summary object only.

---

## Summary Output

At the end of every execution (regardless of mode), provide a summary:

```json
{
  "skill": "codeprobe-testing",
  "summary": { "critical": 0, "major": 0, "minor": 0, "suggestion": 0 }
}
```

Replace the zeros with actual counts from the analysis.
