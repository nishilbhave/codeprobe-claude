</p>

Senior-engineer code review as an [agent skill](https://skills.sh). Run `/codeprobe audit .` and get a full health report in seconds.

- **9 review categories** -- security, SOLID, architecture, error handling, performance, test quality, code smells, design patterns, framework best practices
- **Severity-scored findings** with file locations and copy-pasteable fix prompts
- **Auto-detects your stack** -- Python, TypeScript, React/Next.js, PHP/Laravel, SQL, and more
- **Strictly read-only** -- never modifies your code
- **Works with 45+ agents** -- Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Cline, and more

---

## Sample Output

Every `/codeprobe audit` opens with a visual **health dashboard** (category scores, codebase stats, hot-spot files), then lists detailed P0-P3 findings with fix prompts, and saves the whole report to `./codeprobe-reports/<timestamp>.md`.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add nishilbhave/codeprobe
```

Then run `/codeprobe audit .` in any project.

**Manage:** `npx skills update` • `npx skills remove`

**Optional:** Python 3.8+ enables codebase statistics in the `/codeprobe audit` dashboard.

**Reports are saved** to `./codeprobe-reports/<timestamp>.md` in your current directory. Add `codeprobe-reports/` to your `.gitignore` to keep them out of source control.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/codeprobe audit <path>` | Full audit -- health dashboard (scores, file statistics, hot spots) plus detailed findings with fix prompts |
| `/codeprobe quick <path>` | Top 5 most impactful issues with fix prompts |
| `/codeprobe security <path>` | Security vulnerability detection |
| `/codeprobe solid <path>` | SOLID principles analysis |
| `/codeprobe architecture <path>` | Architecture and dependency analysis |
| `/codeprobe performance <path>` | Performance audit |
| `/codeprobe errors <path>` | Error handling audit |
| `/codeprobe tests <path>` | Test quality audit |
| `/codeprobe smells <path>` | Code smell detection |
| `/codeprobe patterns <path>` | Design patterns analysis |
| `/codeprobe framework <path>` | Framework best practices |

If no path is given, the current working directory is used.

### Running on a specific path

The `<path>` argument works the same way for every command above. It can be a directory *or* a single file, and can be relative or absolute.

```bash
# Current directory (same as passing no path)
/codeprobe audit .

# A subdirectory
/codeprobe audit ./src/backend

# An absolute path
/codeprobe audit /Users/me/projects/myapp

# A single file
/codeprobe audit ./src/api/auth.ts

# Scope a single category to a subfolder
/codeprobe security ./src/api
/codeprobe solid    ./backend/services
/codeprobe quick    ./src/checkout
```

**Notes on paths:**

- Relative paths are resolved against the directory Claude Code was started in.
- Only files inside the given path are analyzed — everything else is ignored.
- The report is always saved to `./codeprobe-reports/<timestamp>.md` in your **current working directory**, regardless of which path you scanned. `cd` into the project first if you want the report to land there.

## How It Works

The system uses an **orchestrator + sub-skill** architecture:

1. **Orchestrator** (`skills/codeprobe/SKILL.md`) -- Routes commands, detects your tech stack, loads config, and invokes specialized sub-skills.
2. **Sub-skills** -- Domain experts that each analyze one category:
   - `codeprobe-security` -- SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, auth issues
   - `codeprobe-error-handling` -- Swallowed exceptions, missing try/catch, transaction safety
   - `codeprobe-solid` -- Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
   - `codeprobe-architecture` -- Coupling, layering violations, circular dependencies, god objects
   - `codeprobe-patterns` -- Design pattern opportunities and anti-patterns
   - `codeprobe-performance` -- N+1 queries, unbounded queries, algorithmic efficiency, caching
   - `codeprobe-code-smells` -- Long methods, deep nesting, duplicate code, primitive obsession
   - `codeprobe-testing` -- Missing tests, test smells, mock abuse, coverage gaps
   - `codeprobe-framework` -- Laravel, React/Next.js, Python/Django framework idiom violations
3. **Reference guides** (`skills/codeprobe/references/`) -- Stack-specific best practices loaded based on auto-detected languages.
4. **Scripts** (`skills/codeprobe/scripts/`) -- Deterministic analysis utilities:
   - `file_stats.py` -- LOC, file counts, method counts per file
   - `complexity_scorer.py` -- Cyclomatic complexity per function
   - `dependency_mapper.py` -- Import graph and circular dependency detection
   - `generate_report.py` -- Markdown report generation from audit findings

Stack detection is automatic. The orchestrator scans for file extensions and project markers (e.g., `next.config.*`, `migrations/` directory) and loads the appropriate reference guides.

## Scoring

Each category is scored independently:

```
crit_penalty  = min(50, critical_count * 15)
major_penalty = min(30, major_count * 6)
minor_penalty = min(10, minor_count * 2)

category_score = max(0, 100 - crit_penalty - major_penalty - minor_penalty)
```

Suggestions do not affect scores. The overall score is a weighted average of active categories:

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Security | 20% |
| SOLID | 15% |
| Architecture | 15% |
| Error Handling | 12% |
| Performance | 12% |
| Test Quality | 10% |
| Code Smells | 8% |
| Design Patterns | 4% |
| Framework | 4% |

| Score Range | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| 80-100 | Healthy |
| 60-79 | Needs Attention |
| 0-59 | Critical |

---

## Configuration

Create a `.codeprobe-config.json` in your project root to customize behavior:

```json
{
  "severity_overrides": {
    "long_method_loc": 50,
    "large_class_loc": 500,
    "deep_nesting_max": 4,
    "max_constructor_deps": 6
  },
  "skip_categories": ["codeprobe-testing"],
  "skip_rules": ["SPEC-GEN-001"],
  "framework": "laravel",
  "extra_references": [],
  "report_format": "markdown"
}
```

All fields are optional. If the file is absent, defaults apply. If `skip_categories` is set, weights are normalized to 100%.

---

## Stack Support

Auto-detected languages and frameworks with dedicated reference guides:

- **Python** -- PEP standards, Django/Flask patterns, type hinting
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** -- ES modules, async patterns, type safety
- **React / Next.js** -- Component patterns, hooks, SSR/SSG
- **PHP / Laravel** -- Eloquent, service patterns, blade templates
- **SQL / Database** -- Query optimization, schema design, migrations
- **API Design** -- REST conventions, validation, error responses

Additional languages recognized for file statistics: Java, Ruby, Go, Rust, Vue, Svelte, Shell, CSS/SCSS, HTML.

## Claude.ai Support

When used on Claude.ai (without filesystem access), the skill runs in **degraded mode**: it analyzes pasted or uploaded code directly, skips codebase statistics and diff review, and notes the limitation. Findings and scoring still work normally.
